# Mobile-based-Health-Monitoring-System-with-Machine-learning-Insights-for-Cardiovascular-Patients

Overview of the Project
This mobile-based health monitoring system is designed to support cardiovascular patients in maintaining their health metrics, predicting risks, and adopting a healthier lifestyle. The application provides personalized insights, predictive analytics, and real-time feedback using advanced machine learning algorithms and an intuitive interface that enables patients to manage their conditions effectively.

# Key Features:

* data collection and preprocessing

The glucose levels, blood pressure, lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake), and heredity data would be the inputs.
Ensures data quality by validating, normalizing, and following security protocols that involve sensitive health information.
Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics:

Implements predictive models for cardiovascular risk assessment, including heart failure and hypertension.
Offers patients personalized daily health scores to observe and modify their health behaviors.
3D Pain Localization:

Also, it offers an interactive 3D model for logging pain locations, including chest pain, which is critical for cardiovascular patients.
It detects critical situations, such as high chest pain scores, and alerts in real time for immediate action.
User Insights and Reports:

Generates health summaries and personalized recommendations based on user metrics and cardiovascular risk factors.
Tracks long-term health improvements to motivate patients and provide actionable insights for clinicians.
Architectural Diagram
The system architecture is designed for seamless data flow and modularity to ensure that each component effectively supports the care for cardiovascular patients.

* Data Collection and Preprocessing

Patients input health metrics via a mobile app interface.
The data gets validated, normalized, and then stored in the backend database for further analysis.
Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics:

Machine learning models analyze patient data to predict cardiovascular risks and assess lifestyle impacts.

Trend-based forecasting is included to identify potential warning signals over time.

3D Interface for Pain Localization: Enables users to log pain points accurately on a virtual 3D human model. Emergency detection algorithms analyze crucial pain information and alert medical staff if necessary. User Insights and Reports Generation: Summarizes patient information in easy-to-read reports. Provides tips to minimize cardiovascular risks and maintain good health.
